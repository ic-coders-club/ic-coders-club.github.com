		<h1>Who's it for?</h1>
		<p>We call ourselves particle physicists, yet spend our days wrestling with computers.
		If you've ever had a problem, ever missed a semi-colon, then Coder's Club is for you.
		</p>

		<h1>Background</h1>

		<p>It's no coincidence that they're called programming <b> languages</b>: they all have a vocabulary and a grammar.
		And just like when you learn to speak a real language, the best way to learn is by <b>practice</b>, surrounded by <b>others</b> who correct you when you make a mistake, and tell you better and more succinct ways to say what you're trying to say.
		</p>

		<p>  
		But <b>in computing, the conversation's a bit one-sided.</b>
		You're told when you've gone wrong and occasionally where, but not how to correct the problem and you're certainly never told how to improve a working method.
		</p>

		<p>  
		<b>Coder's club</b> is therefore about <b>dialogue</b>.
		If you ask a work mate for advice and they give you a good tip, let everyone know it.
		If you email your supervisor, and they suggest a method that you'd not seen before, don't just keep it to yourself, mention it at one of the meet-ups.
		If Google gives you a useful webpage, give a mention of it here.
		</p>

		<h1> Coder's Club Aims</h1>
		To put it another way, we want to use the Coder's Club to:
		<ol>
		    <li>openly <b>share</b> computing knowledge between many people at once,</li>
		    <li><b>improve</b> the quality of coding at Imperial HEP,</li>
		    <li><b>support</b> and consolidate existing help.</li>

		</ol>

		<h1> Resources</h1>
		To meet these aims we have four approaches: a wiki for tips and tricks, a GitHub repositry for code snippets and monthly informal meetings for people to share their ideas.

		<h2><a href ="http://ichep-coders-club.github.com/past_meetings.html" >Regular Meetings</a><BR></h2>
		These informal meetings take place monthly and act as a forum to share ideas, problems, solutions and anything you think may be useful for other people to hear about.
		This includes demonstrations of a new technique you've come across, or a new program / command you've discovered.
		Or else if you've had on-going issues with some system, you can bring it to this to discuss it with others.

		<h2><a href ="http://ichep-coders-club.github.com/index.html">The Wiki</a><BR></h2>
		Here you can find lists of useful commands and libraries, and a brief explanation and examples on how to use them.
		You can also find links to other relevant external pages, so if you're ever faced with a new problem or want to see if you can do something in a better way, come here to see if anyone else has a useful suggestion.

		<h2><a href ="http://www.github.com/ic-hep-snippets-and-tools" target="_blank">GitHub</a><BR></h2>
		The GitHub repositry is there to store any code snippets or tools that you think might be useful to others.  
		For example, here you can find example makefiles, simple custom built tools made by other HEP-ers, or useful configuration files for common programs.
		This is referenced by the Wiki.

		<h2><a href ="http://ichep-coders-club.github.com/mail.html" >The Mailing List</a><BR></h2>
		The Mailing list is a way to seek help from anyone else signed up to the mailing list immediately.
		If you're struck with debugging some python script, and you've checked the Wiki and Google's not being much help, send the list an email. 
		Then when you get a solution add it to the wiki to help the next person who has that problem.
